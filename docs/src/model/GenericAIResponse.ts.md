## Interface Description

The `GenericAIResponse` interface is a simple TypeScript interface that defines the structure of a generic AI response object. It contains two properties: `answer`, which is a string representing the AI's response, and `requestMessages`, which is an array of `ChatCompletionRequestMessage` objects representing the request messages sent to the AI.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `GenericAIResponse` interface in your TypeScript code:

```typescript
import { ChatCompletionRequestMessage } from "openai";
import GenericAIResponse from "./GenericAIResponse";

// Example 1: Creating a GenericAIResponse object
const response: GenericAIResponse = {
  answer: "Hello, how can I help you?",
  requestMessages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Hello!",
    },
  ],
};

// Example 2: Accessing properties of a GenericAIResponse object
console.log(response.answer); // Output: Hello, how can I help you?
console.log(response.requestMessages); // Output: Array of ChatCompletionRequestMessage objects
```

## Methods and Properties

### answer

The `answer` property is a string that represents the AI's response to a given input. It is a required property of the `GenericAIResponse` interface.

### requestMessages

The `requestMessages` property is an array of `ChatCompletionRequestMessage` objects. Each object in the array represents a request message sent to the AI. The `ChatCompletionRequestMessage` is an interface imported from the `openai` package and contains properties such as `role` and `content`. The `requestMessages` property is also required in the `GenericAIResponse` interface.

## Technical Concepts

### TypeScript Interfaces

In TypeScript, interfaces are used to define the structure of an object. They can be used to enforce a specific shape for an object, ensuring that the object has the required properties with the correct types. In this code file, the `GenericAIResponse` interface is used to define the structure of a generic AI response object.

### ChatCompletionRequestMessage

The `ChatCompletionRequestMessage` is an interface imported from the `openai` package. It represents a message sent to the AI as part of a chat completion request. The interface contains properties such as `role` (which can be "system", "user", or "assistant") and `content` (which is the actual content of the message).
