# cli.ts

## Overview

The `cli.ts` file is an entry point for a command-line interface (CLI) application built using the `App` class. This file initializes the `App` class and runs the application.

## Usage

To use the `cli.ts` file, you can run it directly from the command line using the following command:

```bash
$ ./cli.ts
```

Alternatively, you can use Node.js to execute the file:

```bash
$ node cli.ts
```

## App Class

The `App` class is imported from the `App.ts` file and is responsible for managing the application's functionality. The `App` class should contain methods and properties that define the behavior of the CLI application.

### Initialization

The `App` class is initialized using the following code:

```typescript
let app = new App();
```

This creates a new instance of the `App` class and assigns it to the `app` variable.

### Running the Application

To run the application, call the `run` method on the `app` instance:

```typescript
app.run();
```

This method should contain the main logic of the CLI application, such as parsing command-line arguments, executing commands, and displaying output.

## Methods

### run()

The `run` method is responsible for executing the main logic of the CLI application. This method should be implemented in the `App` class to handle command-line arguments, execute commands, and display output.

## Technical Concepts

### Shebang

The first line of the `cli.ts` file is a shebang:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

This line tells the operating system to use the Node.js interpreter to execute the script. This allows the script to be run directly from the command line, as mentioned in the Usage section.

## Conclusion

The `cli.ts` file serves as the entry point for a CLI application built using the `App` class. It initializes the `App` class, runs the application, and handles command-line arguments and output.
