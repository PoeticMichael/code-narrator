# DefaultSettings.ts

This is a TypeScript code file that defines the `DefaultSettings` class. The class is responsible for providing default settings for the Code Narrator application. It includes various settings such as paths, file names, and configurations for the application.

## Usage

To use the `DefaultSettings` class, simply import it and call the `get()` method to retrieve the default settings.

```typescript
import DefaultSettings from "./DefaultSettings";

const settings = DefaultSettings.get();
```

## Methods

### get(): ICodeNarratorConfig

This method returns an object containing the default settings for the Code Narrator application. The returned object implements the `ICodeNarratorConfig` interface.

### getFilesToExclude(): string[]

This private method returns an array of file and folder paths that should be excluded from the documentation generation process. It combines the default exclusion list with the paths specified in the `.gitignore` file.

## Properties

### gptModel: string

This static property holds the GPT model version to be used by the application. The default value is `'gpt-4'`.

## ICodeNarratorConfig Interface

The `ICodeNarratorConfig` interface defines the structure of the configuration object returned by the `get()` method. It includes properties such as:

- `config_files`: An array of configuration file names.
- `project_file`: The main project file name.
- `entry_file`: The entry point file for the application.
- `cli_file`: The command-line interface file for the application.
- `project_path`: The root path of the project.
- `source_path`: The path to the source code folder.
- `documentation_path`: The path to the documentation folder.
- `test_path`: The path to the test folder.
- `exclude`: An array of file and folder paths to exclude from the documentation generation process.
- `readmeRoot`: A boolean indicating whether to generate a README file at the root of the documentation folder.
- `repository_url`: The URL of the project's repository.
- `builderPlugins`: An array of builder plugin classes.
- `gptSystemCommands`: An array of GPT system commands.
- `documentation_type`: The format of the generated documentation (e.g., `'md'` for Markdown).
- `document_file_extension`: The file extension for the generated documentation files.
- `folderRootFileName`: The file name for the root file in each documentation folder.
- `cache_file`: The path to the cache file.
- `gptModel`: The GPT model version to be used by the application.
- `aiService`: The AI service to be used by the application, implementing the `IGenericAIService` interface.

## Notes

- The `builderPlugins` array determines the order in which the builder plugins are executed. The `ConfigurationBuilder` plugin should always be run first to get an overview of the project.
- The `cache_file` should be committed to the Git repository to ensure consistency across different environments.
