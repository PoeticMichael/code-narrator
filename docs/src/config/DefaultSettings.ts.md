# DefaultSettings.ts

This is a TypeScript code file that defines the `DefaultSettings` class. The class is responsible for providing default settings and configurations for a software documentation project. It includes methods for retrieving and excluding specific files, as well as configuring various aspects of the documentation generation process.

## Usage

To use the `DefaultSettings` class, simply import it and call the `get()` method to retrieve the default settings.

```typescript
import DefaultSettings from "./DefaultSettings";

const settings = DefaultSettings.get();
```

## Class Methods

### get()

This method returns an object containing the default settings for the documentation project. The settings include:

- `config_files`: An array of configuration file names.
- `project_file`: The main project file name.
- `entry_file`: The entry point file for the application.
- `cli_file`: The command-line interface file for the application.
- `project_path`: The root path of the project.
- `source_path`: The path to the source code.
- `documentation_path`: The path to the generated documentation.
- `test_path`: The path to the test files.
- `exclude`: An array of files and folders to exclude from the documentation.
- `readmeRoot`: A boolean indicating whether to generate a README file at the root of the documentation.
- `repository_url`: The URL of the project's repository.
- `builderPlugins`: An array of builder plugins to use for generating the documentation.
- `gptSystemCommands`: An array of GPT system commands for generating documentation.
- `documentation_type`: The format of the generated documentation (e.g., 'md' for Markdown).
- `document_file_extension`: The file extension for the generated documentation files.
- `folderRootFileName`: The file name for the root file in each folder of the documentation.
- `cache_file`: The path to the cache file.
- `gptModel`: The GPT model to use for generating documentation.
- `aiService`: An instance of the AI service to use for generating documentation.

### getFilesToExclude()

This private method returns an array of files and folders to exclude from the documentation. It combines the contents of the `.gitignore` file with a set of default exclusions.

## Technical Concepts

### ICodeNarratorConfig

This is an interface that defines the shape of the configuration object returned by the `get()` method. It ensures that the object adheres to the expected structure and contains the required properties.

### FileStructure

This is a utility class that provides methods for working with the file system, such as reading the contents of a file or listing the files in a directory.

### OpenAIService

This is a service class that provides methods for interacting with the OpenAI API, such as generating text using a GPT model.

## Notes and Warnings

:::note
The `cache_file` setting should be committed into the Git repository to ensure that the cache is maintained across different environments.
