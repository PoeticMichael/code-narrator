# DefaultSettings.ts

This is a TypeScript code file that contains the `DefaultSettings` class. The class is responsible for providing default settings for the Code Narrator application. It includes various configurations, such as file paths, builder plugins, GPT system commands, and documentation settings.

## Usage

To use the `DefaultSettings` class, simply import it and call the `get()` method to retrieve the default settings.

```typescript
import DefaultSettings from "./DefaultSettings";

const settings = DefaultSettings.get();
```

## Methods

### get()

This method returns an object containing the default settings for the Code Narrator application. The settings include:

- `config_files`: An array of configuration file names.
- `project_file`: The main project file name.
- `entry_file`: The entry file for the application.
- `cli_file`: The command-line interface file for the application.
- `project_path`: The project root path.
- `source_path`: The source code path.
- `documentation_path`: The documentation output path.
- `test_path`: The test code path.
- `exclude`: An array of file and folder paths to exclude from documentation generation.
- `readmeRoot`: A boolean indicating whether to generate a README file at the root of the documentation folder.
- `repository_url`: The URL of the project's repository.
- `builderPlugins`: An array of builder plugins to use for documentation generation.
- `gptSystemCommands`: An array of GPT system commands for the documentation expert.
- `documentation_type`: The output format for the generated documentation (e.g., 'md' for Markdown).
- `document_file_extension`: The file extension for the generated documentation files.
- `folderRootFileName`: The file name for the root file in each documentation folder.
- `cache_file`: The path to the cache file.
- `gptModel`: The GPT model to use for documentation generation.

### getFilesToExclude()

This private method returns an array of file and folder paths to exclude from documentation generation. It combines the contents of the `.gitignore` file with a set of default exclusions.

## Technical Concepts

### ICodeNarratorConfig

The `ICodeNarratorConfig` interface is used to define the shape of the configuration object returned by the `get()` method. It includes all the properties listed in the `get()` method description.

### FileStructure

The `FileStructure` utility is used to read the contents of the `.gitignore` file and manipulate file paths.

### Builder Plugins

The `builderPlugins` array contains a list of builder classes that are responsible for generating different parts of the documentation. These builders include:

- `ConfigurationBuilder`: Generates documentation for the project's configuration.
- `FilesBuilder`: Generates documentation for individual files in the project.
- `FoldersBuilder`: Generates documentation for folders in the project.
- `UserDefinedBuilder`: Generates user-defined documentation.

## Notes and Warnings

- The `cache_file` setting should be committed to the project's Git repository. This is indicated by the following comment in the code:

  :::warning
  '.code-narrator/cache.json' should be committed into git.
  :::

- The order of the `builderPlugins` array matters, as the `ConfigurationBuilder` must run first to provide an overview of the project.
