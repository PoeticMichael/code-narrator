# DefaultSettings.ts

This is a TypeScript code file that defines the `DefaultSettings` class. This class is responsible for providing default settings for the Code Narrator application. The settings include configuration files, project paths, builder plugins, GPT system commands, and other related configurations.

## Usage

To use the `DefaultSettings` class, simply import it and call the `get()` method to retrieve the default settings.

```typescript
import DefaultSettings from "./DefaultSettings";

const settings = DefaultSettings.get();
```

## Methods

### get(): ICodeNarratorConfig

This method returns an object containing the default settings for the Code Narrator application. The returned object implements the `ICodeNarratorConfig` interface.

### getFilesToExclude(): string[]

This private static method returns an array of file and folder paths that should be excluded from the Code Narrator application. It combines the default exclusions with the ones specified in the `.gitignore` file.

## Properties

### gptModel: string

This static property holds the GPT model name, which is set to `'gpt-4'`.

## Configuration Object

The configuration object returned by the `get()` method contains the following properties:

- `config_files`: An array of configuration file names.
- `project_file`: The main project file name.
- `entry_file`: The entry file for the application.
- `cli_file`: The command-line interface file for the application.
- `project_path`: The project root path.
- `source_path`: The source code path.
- `documentation_path`: The documentation output path.
- `test_path`: The test code path.
- `exclude`: An array of file and folder paths to exclude.
- `readmeRoot`: A boolean indicating whether to generate a root README file.
- `repository_url`: The URL of the repository.
- `builderPlugins`: An array of builder plugin classes.
- `gptSystemCommands`: An array of GPT system commands.
- `documentation_type`: The output documentation format (e.g., `'md'` for Markdown).
- `document_file_extension`: The file extension for the generated documentation files.
- `folderRootFileName`: The file name for the root file in each folder.
- `cache_file`: The cache file location.
- `gptModel`: The GPT model name.

:::note
The `cache_file` property has a warning comment: `'code-narrator/cache.json' should be committed into git`.

## Technical Concepts

### ICodeNarratorConfig

This is an interface that defines the shape of the configuration object for the Code Narrator application. It includes properties for paths, file names, plugins, and other settings.

### Builder Plugins

The `builderPlugins` array contains classes that are responsible for generating documentation for different aspects of the project. The order of the plugins matters, as the `ConfigurationBuilder` runs first to get an overview of the project. The other plugins include `FilesBuilder`, `FoldersBuilder`, and `UserDefinedBuilder`.

### GPT System Commands

The `gptSystemCommands` array contains commands that are used to interact with the GPT model for generating documentation. These commands include instructions for formatting and handling sensitive information.
