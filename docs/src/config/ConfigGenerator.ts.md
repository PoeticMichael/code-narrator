# ConfigGenerator.ts

This is a TypeScript code file that contains the `ConfigGenerator` class. The class is responsible for generating a configuration object for the Code Narrator project based on user input and default settings. It also handles the serialization of the configuration object to a file.

## Usage

To use the `ConfigGenerator` class, you need to import it and call the `generate` method with an optional `projectConfig` object.

```typescript
import ConfigGenerator from "./ConfigGenerator";

(async () => {
    const projectConfig = {
        project_name: "My Project",
        source_path: "./src",
    };

    const config = await ConfigGenerator.generate(projectConfig);
})();
```

## Class: ConfigGenerator

### Method: generate

This method generates a configuration object for the Code Narrator project based on user input and default settings. It returns a Promise that resolves to the generated configuration object.

#### Parameters

- `projectConfig` (Optional): A partial `ICodeNarratorConfig` object that can be used to override default settings.

#### Returns

A Promise that resolves to a `Partial<ICodeNarratorConfig>` object.

### Method: getDocPath (private)

This private method is used to determine the documentation path based on the provided configuration object and user input.

#### Parameters

- `config`: An `ICodeNarratorConfig` object containing the current configuration.
- `json`: A JSON object containing user input.

#### Returns

A string representing the documentation path.

## Additional Classes and Interfaces

The file also imports and uses the following classes and interfaces:

- `ICodeNarratorConfig`: An interface that defines the structure of the configuration object.
- `DefaultSettings`: A class that provides default settings for the configuration object.
- `ConfigQuestion`: A class that handles user input for the configuration object.
- `ConfigHelper`: A class that provides helper methods for working with the configuration object.
- `ConfigFileSerializer`: A class that handles the serialization of the configuration object to a file.
