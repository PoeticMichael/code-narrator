## Class Description

The `DocumentationBuilder` class is responsible for generating documentation using various builder plugins. It initializes an instance of the `OpenAIRepository` class and sets the project path. The main functionality of this class is to build the documentation using the configured builder plugins.

## Examples

To use the `DocumentationBuilder` class, you can create an instance and call the `build` method:

```typescript
import DocumentationBuilder from './DocumentationBuilder';

const docBuilder = new DocumentationBuilder();
docBuilder.build();
```

## Methods

### constructor

The constructor initializes the `DocumentationBuilder` class. It creates a new instance of the `OpenAIRepository` class and sets the project path.

```typescript
constructor()
```

### build

The `build` method is an asynchronous method that generates the documentation using the configured builder plugins. It iterates through the list of plugins, creates an instance of each plugin, and calls the `generate` method on each plugin.

```typescript
public async build()
```

## Technical Concepts

- **OpenAIRepository**: This class is responsible for interacting with the OpenAI API. It is used by the `DocumentationBuilder` to generate documentation using the OpenAI API.
- **BaseBuilder**: This is an abstract class that serves as a base for all builder plugins. Each builder plugin should extend this class and implement the `generate` method.
- **ConfigHelper**: This class is responsible for managing the application's configuration. It is used by the `DocumentationBuilder` to get the list of configured builder plugins.
- **BuilderPlugins**: These are the plugins that extend the `BaseBuilder` class and implement the `generate` method. They are responsible for generating documentation using different methods or APIs.
