# CodeDocument

The `CodeDocument` class is an extension of the `BaseDocument` class that provides additional functionality for handling code documentation. It is designed to work with code overviews, flowcharts, and naming suggestions to generate a comprehensive documentation for a given code file.

## Usage

To use the `CodeDocument` class, you first need to import it:

```javascript
import CodeDocument from "./CodeDocument";
```

Then, you can create a new instance of the class by passing a `Document` object to the constructor:

```javascript
const document = new Document(/* ... */);
const codeDocument = new CodeDocument(document);
```

Once you have an instance of the `CodeDocument` class, you can access its properties and methods to generate the documentation content:

```javascript
const content = codeDocument.getMyContent();
```

## Methods

### constructor(suggestion: Document)

The constructor takes a `Document` object as its only parameter and initializes the `CodeDocument` instance. It sets the `summary` property and populates the `methods` map with method descriptions, flowcharts, and naming suggestions.

### getMyContent(): string

This method generates the documentation content for the code file. It returns a string containing the summary, method descriptions, naming suggestions, and flowcharts in a formatted manner.

## Properties

### summary: string

The `summary` property contains a brief overview of the code file. It is generated by the constructor and can be accessed directly.

### methods: Map<string, any>

The `methods` property is a map that stores information about each method in the code file. The keys are the method names, and the values are objects containing the method description, suggested name, and flowchart.

## Technical Concepts

### CodeOverview

The `CodeOverview` type is an object that represents a high-level overview of the code file. It contains an array of `methods`, where each method has a `name` and a `description`.

### FlowChart

The `FlowChart` plugin generates flowcharts for each method in the code file. The flowcharts are stored in the `methods` map and can be accessed using the method name as the key.

### Naming

The `Naming` plugin provides naming suggestions for each method in the code file. The suggested names are stored in the `methods` map and can be accessed using the method name as the key.
