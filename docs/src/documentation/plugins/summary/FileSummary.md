# FileSummary

The `FileSummary` class is a plugin that helps in generating in-depth documentation for a given file. It extends the `BasePlugin` class and takes a `Document` object as a parameter in its constructor. The main functionality of this class is to generate a question for GPT based on the file type and content, and then process the answer provided by GPT.

## Usage

To use this class, you need to import it and create an instance by passing a `Document` object to its constructor. Here's an example:

```javascript
import Document from "../../Document";
import FileSummary from "./FileSummary";

const document = new Document();
const fileSummary = new FileSummary(document);
```

## Methods

### getQuestion(text: string, folder: FolderStructure, file: FileStructure): Promise<string | undefined>

This method generates a question for GPT based on the file type and content. It takes three parameters:

- `text`: The content of the file.
- `folder`: A `FolderStructure` object representing the folder containing the file.
- `file`: A `FileStructure` object representing the file itself.

The method returns a promise that resolves to a string containing the generated question or `undefined` if the question cannot be generated.

### processPluginAnswer(): void

This method processes the answer provided by GPT. It can be left empty, but if you want to work with the answer, you can do it here. The answer is provided in the `this.answer` variable. If you expected JSON from the question, `this.answer` will be an object if JSON parsing was successful.

### getByFilename(text: string, file: FileStructure): string

This private method returns a string based on the file type and content. It takes two parameters:

- `text`: The content of the file.
- `file`: A `FileStructure` object representing the file itself.

The returned string is used as part of the question generated for GPT in the `getQuestion` method.

## Technical Concepts

The `FileSummary` class uses the `Helper.removeExtension` utility function to remove the file extension from the file name. This is useful when generating the question for GPT, as it allows the question to be more specific to the file type.

The class also uses the `FolderStructure` and `FileStructure` utility classes to represent the folder and file, respectively. These classes provide a convenient way to work with the file system and its structure.

## Document Structure

When writing the documentation for a file, the `FileSummary` class suggests dividing the document into sections with clear headings and subheadings. This makes the document easier to read and understand. For example, when documenting a TypeScript file, the class suggests the following structure:

- Write a detailed description of the code.
- Give multiple examples of how to use the class.
- Create a description for each method in the code.
- List out the parameters in methods (if any) and write a description for each parameter.
- Explain technical concepts that are not standard but come apparent in the code.
