# PrerequisitesBuilder.ts

The `PrerequisitesBuilder.ts` file is a TypeScript module that exports a `PrerequisitesBuilder` class. This class is responsible for generating and rendering prerequisite documentation for a given project. It extends the `BaseBuilder` class and utilizes various utility classes and methods to achieve its functionality.

## Usage

To use the `PrerequisitesBuilder` class, you need to import it and create an instance by passing a `project` object to the constructor. Then, you can call the `generate()` and `render()` methods to generate and render the prerequisite documentation, respectively.

```typescript
import PrerequisitesBuilder from "./PrerequisitesBuilder";

const project = { /* project data */ };
const prerequisitesBuilder = new PrerequisitesBuilder(project);

await prerequisitesBuilder.generate();
const document = DocumentationCache.get("Prerequisites");
const renderedDocumentation = await prerequisitesBuilder.render(document);
```

## Class Methods

### constructor(project: any)

The constructor initializes a new instance of the `PrerequisitesBuilder` class. It takes a single parameter:

- `project`: The project object containing the project data.

### generate()

The `generate()` method is an asynchronous method that generates the prerequisite documentation for the project. It first checks if the documentation is already cached; if not, it reads the project file, prepares the necessary arguments, and generates the documentation using the `generateDocumentationAndCache()` method from the `BaseBuilder` class.

### render(document: Document)

The `render()` method is an asynchronous method that takes a `Document` object as a parameter and returns the rendered documentation as a string.

- `document`: The `Document` object containing the documentation data to be rendered.

## Utility Classes and Methods

The `PrerequisitesBuilder` class makes use of the following utility classes and methods:

- `Document`: A class representing a documentation object.
- `fs`: The `fs` module from Node.js, used for file system operations.
- `path`: The `path` module from Node.js, used for handling file and directory paths.
- `ConfigHelper`: A utility class for handling configuration data.
- `BaseBuilder`: The base class for all builder classes, providing common functionality.
- `DocumentationCache`: A class for caching generated documentation.
- `FileStructure`: A utility class for handling file structures and content.

## Technical Concepts

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types, allowing for better tooling and error checking during development.
- **Asynchronous Methods**: The `generate()` and `render()` methods are asynchronous, meaning they return a `Promise` and can be used with the `await` keyword to wait for their completion before continuing execution.
