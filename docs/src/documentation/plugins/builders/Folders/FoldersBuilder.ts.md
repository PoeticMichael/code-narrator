# FoldersBuilder.ts

The `FoldersBuilder.ts` file is a TypeScript code file that defines a class called `FoldersBuilder`. This class is responsible for generating documentation for a given folder structure and caching the generated documentation. It extends the `BaseBuilder` class and provides methods to query and generate documentation for folders and files within a project.

## Usage

To use the `FoldersBuilder` class, you need to create an instance of the class and call the `generate()` method. This method will generate the documentation for the folder structure and cache it.

```typescript
const foldersBuilder = new FoldersBuilder();
await foldersBuilder.generate();
```

## Class Methods

### generate()

This method is responsible for generating the documentation for the folder structure. It creates a new `ProjectStructure` instance, gets the folder structure, and then calls the `queryForFolder()` method to generate the documentation for each folder.

### queryForFolder(folder: FolderStructure, position: number)

This method is responsible for generating the documentation for a specific folder. It takes two parameters:

- `folder`: A `FolderStructure` object representing the folder for which the documentation should be generated.
- `position`: A number representing the position of the folder in the project structure.

The method iterates through the subfolders and files within the folder, generating the documentation for each and caching it using the `DocumentationCache` class.

### getFileSummary(file: FileStructure)

This method takes a `FileStructure` object as a parameter and returns a summary of the file's documentation. It retrieves the cached documentation for the file and extracts a summary using a regular expression.

### getFolderSummary(folder: FolderStructure)

This method takes a `FolderStructure` object as a parameter and returns a summary of the folder's documentation. It retrieves the cached documentation for the folder and extracts a summary using a regular expression.

## Technical Concepts

### FolderStructure and FileStructure

These are utility classes used to represent the structure of folders and files within a project. They provide methods to interact with the file system and retrieve information about the files and folders.

### DocumentationCache

This class is responsible for caching the generated documentation for folders and files. It provides methods to store and retrieve the cached documentation.

### ConfigHelper

This class is responsible for managing the configuration settings for the project. It provides methods to read and update the configuration settings.

## Example

```typescript
import FoldersBuilder from './FoldersBuilder';

async function main() {
  const foldersBuilder = new FoldersBuilder();
  await foldersBuilder.generate();
}

main();
```

In this example, we import the `FoldersBuilder` class, create an instance of the class, and call the `generate()` method to generate the documentation for the folder structure.
