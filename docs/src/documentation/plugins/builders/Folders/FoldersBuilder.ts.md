# FoldersBuilder.ts

This is a TypeScript code file that defines a `FoldersBuilder` class, which is responsible for generating documentation for a folder structure in a project. The class extends the `BaseBuilder` class and provides methods to generate and render documentation for folders and files within the project.

## Usage

To use the `FoldersBuilder` class, you need to create an instance of the class and call the `generate()` method. This method will generate the documentation for the folder structure of the project.

```typescript
import FoldersBuilder from './path/to/FoldersBuilder';

const foldersBuilder = new FoldersBuilder();
await foldersBuilder.generate();
```

## Methods

### constructor()

The constructor initializes the `FoldersBuilder` class with the name 'Folders'.

### generate(): Promise<void>

This asynchronous method generates the documentation for the folder structure of the project. It creates a new `ProjectStructure` instance, retrieves the folder structure, and then calls the `queryForFolder()` method for each folder in the structure.

### queryForFolder(folder: FolderStructure, position: number): Promise<void>

This asynchronous method generates the documentation for a specific folder and its subfolders. It takes two parameters:

- `folder`: A `FolderStructure` instance representing the folder to generate documentation for.
- `position`: A number representing the position of the folder in the sidebar.

The method iterates through the subfolders and files in the folder, generating documentation for each and caching the results using the `DocumentationCache` class.

### render(document: Document): Promise<string>

This asynchronous method takes a `Document` instance as a parameter and returns the documentation as a string.

### getFileSummary(file: FileStructure): string

This method takes a `FileStructure` instance as a parameter and returns a summary of the file's documentation. It retrieves the cached documentation for the file and extracts a summary using a regular expression.

### getFolderSummary(folder: FolderStructure): string

This method takes a `FolderStructure` instance as a parameter and returns a summary of the folder's documentation. It retrieves the cached documentation for the folder and extracts a summary using a regular expression.

## Technical Concepts

### FolderStructure and FileStructure

These utility classes represent the structure of folders and files within a project. They provide methods to interact with the file system and retrieve information about the project's structure.

### DocumentationCache

This class is responsible for caching the generated documentation for folders and files. It provides methods to store and retrieve cached documentation.

### ConfigHelper

This class is responsible for managing the configuration of the project. It provides methods to retrieve configuration values, such as the repository URL.
