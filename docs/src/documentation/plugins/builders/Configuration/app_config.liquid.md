## Overview

The `app_config.liquid` file is a template file that contains app-specific configuration settings for a project using {{ projectName }}. These settings are crucial for the proper functioning of the application and must be set correctly to match your project requirements.

The purpose of this configuration file is to store various settings and parameters that can be easily accessed and modified throughout the application. This allows for better organization and maintainability of the codebase.

## Variables

The following variables are used in the `app_config.liquid` template file:

- `fileName`: The name of the app-specific config file.
- `projectName`: The name of the project using {{ projectName }}.
- `configFile`: The content of the app-specific config file.

## Template File

Below is the content of the `app_config.liquid` template file:

```
###
These are the app-specific config files called {{fileName}}.
When you use {{ projectName }} in your project, you need set these configurations correctly to match your project.
Give me a detailed description of them, and what their purpose is in the application if you can decide.
Give example on how to retrieve from the config file
###
{{ configFile }}

```

## Retrieving Configuration Values

To retrieve a value from the `app_config.liquid` file, you can use the following syntax:

```liquid
{% assign config_value = configFile.variable_name %}
```

Replace `variable_name` with the name of the variable you want to retrieve from the configuration file.

For example, if you have a variable called `api_key` in your `app_config.liquid` file, you can retrieve its value like this:

```liquid
{% assign api_key = configFile.api_key %}
```

Now you can use the `api_key` variable in your application as needed.

## Conclusion

The `app_config.liquid` file is an essential part of any project using {{ projectName }}. It allows developers to store and manage app-specific configuration settings in a centralized location, making it easier to maintain and update the application. By understanding the variables used in this template file and how to retrieve configuration values, you can effectively work with the `app_config.liquid` file in your projects.
