## Class: FilesBuilder

The `FilesBuilder` class is responsible for generating documentation for files and folders in a project.

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the `FilesBuilder` class with the name 'Files'.

```typescript
constructor() {
    super('Files');
}
```

### Methods

#### generate

The `generate` method is an asynchronous method that creates a `ProjectStructure` instance, retrieves the folder structure, and calls the `queryForFolder` method with the retrieved folder.

```typescript
public async generate() {
    let structure = new ProjectStructure();
    let folder = await structure.getStructure();
    await this.queryForFolder(folder);
}
```

#### queryForFolder

The `queryForFolder` method is an asynchronous method that takes a `FolderStructure` object as a parameter. It cleans the deleted files from the cache and iterates through the files in the folder. If a file should be documented, it generates the documentation and caches it. It also recursively calls itself for each subfolder in the folder.

```typescript
public async queryForFolder(folder: FolderStructure) {
    // ...
}
```

#### cleanDeletedFilesFromCache

The `cleanDeletedFilesFromCache` method is a private method that takes a `FolderStructure` object as a parameter. It retrieves the cached files for the folder and removes the files that no longer exist in the folder.

```typescript
private cleanDeletedFilesFromCache(folder: FolderStructure) {
    // ...
}
```

#### shouldDocument

The `shouldDocument` method is a private method that takes a `FileStructure` object as a parameter. It checks if the file should be documented based on the configuration's include patterns. If the configuration does not have any include patterns, it returns true.

```typescript
private shouldDocument(file: FileStructure) {
    // ...
}
```
