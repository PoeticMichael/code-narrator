# ReadMeBuilder.ts

ReadMeBuilder.ts is a TypeScript file that is part of a larger documentation generation system. This class is responsible for generating and rendering the README file for a given project. It extends the BaseBuilder class and utilizes various utility classes and methods to achieve its purpose.

## Usage

To use the ReadMeBuilder class, you need to import it and create a new instance by passing the project object to the constructor. Then, you can call the `generate()` and `render()` methods to generate and render the README file, respectively.

```typescript
import ReadMeBuilder from "./ReadMeBuilder";

const project = { /* project object */ };
const readMeBuilder = new ReadMeBuilder(project);

await readMeBuilder.generate();
const document = DocumentationCache.get("ReadMe");
const renderedReadMe = await readMeBuilder.render(document);
```

## Class Methods

### constructor(project: any)

The constructor initializes a new instance of the ReadMeBuilder class. It takes a single parameter:

- `project`: The project object containing information about the project for which the README file is being generated.

### generate()

This asynchronous method generates the README file for the project. It first checks if the README document is already cached; if not, it proceeds to gather the necessary information from the project and calls the `generateDocumentationAndCache()` method from the BaseBuilder class.

### render(document: Document)

This asynchronous method renders the README file using the provided document object. It takes a single parameter:

- `document`: A Document object containing the documentation content to be rendered.

It returns the rendered documentation as a string.

## Technical Concepts

### FileStructure

The FileStructure utility class is used to interact with the file system and retrieve the content of files. It is used in the `generate()` method to read the content of the project file, config file, and entry file.

### ConfigHelper

The ConfigHelper utility class is used to retrieve configuration values from the project. In this case, it is used to get the project name.

### DocumentationCache

The DocumentationCache class is responsible for caching generated documentation. It is used in the `generate()` method to check if the README document is already cached and in the example usage to retrieve the generated README document.

### App

The App class contains global information about the application. In this case, it is used to get the repository URL.
