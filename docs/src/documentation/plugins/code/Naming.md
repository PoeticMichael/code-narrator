# Naming

The `Naming` class is a plugin that helps in evaluating and suggesting better names for methods in a given code. It extends the `BaseCodePlugin` class and works by analyzing the method names in a given code and suggesting alternative names if the current names do not describe the method well.

## Usage

To use the `Naming` class, you need to create an instance of it by passing a `Document` object as a parameter. The `Document` object should contain the code you want to analyze.

```javascript
import Naming from "./Naming";
import Document from "../../Document";

const code = `...`; // Your code here
const suggestion = new Document(code);
const naming = new Naming(suggestion);
```

After creating an instance of the `Naming` class, you can use its methods to analyze the code and get suggestions for better method names.

## Methods

### constructor(suggestion: Document)

The constructor method initializes a new instance of the `Naming` class. It takes a `Document` object as a parameter, which should contain the code you want to analyze.

```javascript
const suggestion = new Document(code);
const naming = new Naming(suggestion);
```

### getPluginQuestion(text: string, folder: FolderStructure, file: FileStructure)

The `getPluginQuestion` method generates a series of questions for each method in the code, asking how well the method name describes the method. If the method name is not good, it asks for three alternative names in camelCase format.

Parameters:

- `text: string`: The text to analyze.
- `folder: FolderStructure`: The folder structure of the code.
- `file: FileStructure`: The file structure of the code.

```javascript
const questions = await naming.getPluginQuestion(text, folder, file);
```

### processPluginAnswer()

The `processPluginAnswer` method processes the answers received from the questions generated by the `getPluginQuestion` method. It updates the method names in the code based on the suggestions provided in the answers.

```javascript
naming.processPluginAnswer();
```

## Technical Concepts

### CreateCompletionResponseChoicesInner

The `CreateCompletionResponseChoicesInner` type is used to define the structure of the response choices when processing the answers. It is imported from the `openai` package.

```javascript
import { CreateCompletionResponseChoicesInner } from "openai";
```

### FolderStructure and FileStructure

The `FolderStructure` and `FileStructure` classes are utility classes that help in managing the folder and file structure of the code. They are imported from the `../../../utils` directory.

```javascript
import FileStructure from "../../../utils/FileStructure";
import FolderStructure from "../../../utils/FolderStructure";
```
