# CodeOverviewDto

This document provides an in-depth overview of the `CodeOverviewDto` file, which contains two interfaces: `Method` and `CodeOverview`. These interfaces are used to define the structure of objects that represent a code overview and its methods. This document will cover the properties of each interface, their descriptions, and examples of how to use them.

## Method Interface

The `Method` interface is used to define the structure of an object representing a method in a code overview. It has the following properties:

### Properties

- `name: string`: The name of the method.
- `description: string`: A brief description of the method.
- `src: string`: The source code of the method.
- `complexity: number`: The complexity of the method.
- `conditions: number`: The number of conditions in the method.
- `number_of_lines: number`: The number of lines in the method.
- `loops: number`: The number of loops in the method.
- `called_functions: number`: The number of functions called by the method.
- `flow? : string`: (Optional) A description of the method's control flow.
- `naming? : string`: (Optional) A description of the method's naming conventions.
- `new_code_suggestion? : string`: (Optional) A suggestion for improving the method's code.
- `queries : any`: An object containing information about the method's queries.

### Example

```typescript
const exampleMethod: Method = {
  name: "calculateTotal",
  description: "Calculates the total price of items in a cart",
  src: "function calculateTotal(items) { ... }",
  complexity: 5,
  conditions: 2,
  number_of_lines: 10,
  loops: 1,
  called_functions: 3,
  flow: "Uses a for loop to iterate through items and calculate the total",
  naming: "Follows camelCase naming convention",
  new_code_suggestion: "Refactor to use Array.prototype.reduce()",
  queries: {
    select: ["item.price"],
    from: "items",
  },
};
```

## CodeOverview Interface

The `CodeOverview` interface is used to define the structure of an object representing a code overview. It has the following properties:

### Properties

- `name: string`: The name of the code overview.
- `description: string`: A brief description of the code overview.
- `methods: Method[]`: An array of `Method` objects representing the methods in the code overview.

### Example

```typescript
const exampleCodeOverview: CodeOverview = {
  name: "ShoppingCart",
  description: "A simple shopping cart implementation",
  methods: [
    {
      name: "addItem",
      description: "Adds an item to the cart",
      src: "function addItem(item) { ... }",
      complexity: 3,
      conditions: 1,
      number_of_lines: 5,
      loops: 0,
      called_functions: 2,
      queries: {
        insert: "items",
      },
    },
    {
      name: "removeItem",
      description: "Removes an item from the cart",
      src: "function removeItem(item) { ... }",
      complexity: 4,
      conditions: 2,
      number_of_lines: 8,
      loops: 1,
      called_functions: 3,
      queries: {
        delete: "items",
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Conclusion

The `CodeOverviewDto` file provides two interfaces, `Method` and `CodeOverview`, which are used to define the structure of objects representing a code overview and its methods. These interfaces can be used to create objects that store information about a code overview, such as its name, description, and methods, as well as detailed information about each method, including its complexity, number of conditions, loops, and called functions.
