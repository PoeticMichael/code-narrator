# Code

This documentation provides an in-depth overview of the files in the folder named `code`. The folder contains six files: [BaseCodePlugin](#basecodeplugin), [Code](#code), [CodeOverviewDto](#codeoverviewdto), [FlowChart](#flowchart), [Naming](#naming), and [NewCode](#newcode). The original source files can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com).

## BaseCodePlugin

The `BaseCodePlugin` is an abstract class that extends the `BasePlugin` class. It is designed to provide a base structure for creating code-related plugins. This class contains methods for generating questions for GPT, checking if a file is a code file, and getting a method by its name.

### Key Features

- Provides a base structure for creating code-related plugins
- Contains methods for generating questions for GPT
- Checks if a file is a code file
- Gets a method by its name

## Code

The `Code` class is a plugin that extends the `BaseCodePlugin` class. It is used to generate a JSON text with a description of a given class, including a list of methods in the class with their descriptions, complexity, and other relevant information. This class can be used to analyze and document code files.

### Key Features

- Generates a JSON text with a description of a given class
- Includes a list of methods in the class with their descriptions, complexity, and other relevant information
- Can be used to analyze and document code files

## CodeOverviewDto

This document provides an in-depth overview of the `CodeOverviewDto` file, which contains two interfaces: `Method` and `CodeOverview`. These interfaces are used to define the structure of objects that represent a code overview and its methods. This document will cover the properties of each interface, their descriptions, and examples of how to use them.

### Key Features

- Contains two interfaces: `Method` and `CodeOverview`
- Defines the structure of objects that represent a code overview and its methods
- Covers the properties of each interface, their descriptions, and examples of how to use them

## FlowChart

The `FlowChart` class is a plugin that extends the `BaseCodePlugin` class. It is used to generate flowcharts for methods in a given code file using the Mermaid format. The flowcharts are generated based on the complexity of the methods.

### Key Features

- Generates flowcharts for methods in a given code file using the Mermaid format
- Flowcharts are generated based on the complexity of the methods

## Naming

The `Naming` class is a plugin that helps in evaluating and suggesting better names for methods in a given code. It extends the `BaseCodePlugin` class and works by analyzing the method names in a given code and suggesting alternative names if the current names do not describe the method well.

### Key Features

- Evaluates and suggests better names for methods in a given code
- Analyzes the method names in a given code and suggests alternative names if the current names do not describe the method well

## NewCode

The `NewCode` class is a plugin that extends the `BaseCodePlugin` class. It is used to generate a question for code review and process the answer provided by the user. The main purpose of this class is to get feedback on the readability, efficiency, and performance of the code.

### Key Features

- Generates a question for code review
- Processes the answer provided by the user
- Gets feedback on the readability, efficiency, and performance of the code
