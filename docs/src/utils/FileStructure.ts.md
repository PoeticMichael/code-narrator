# FileStructure.ts

This is a TypeScript code file that defines a `FileStructure` class. The class is responsible for handling file structures, reading file content, and extracting specific lines from a file.

## Usage

To use the `FileStructure` class, you need to import it and create a new instance by providing the required parameters.

```typescript
import FileStructure from './FileStructure';

const dir = 'path/to/directory';
const entry = { name: 'example.txt' };
const depth = 1;

const fileStructure = new FileStructure(dir, entry, depth);
```

## Class: FileStructure

The `FileStructure` class has the following properties and methods:

### Properties

- `name`: The name of the file.
- `path`: The relative path of the file.
- `entry`: An object containing file information.
- `depth`: The depth of the file in the directory structure.

### Constructor

The constructor takes three parameters:

- `dir: string`: The directory path.
- `entry: any`: An object containing file information.
- `depth: number`: The depth of the file in the directory structure.

### Method: getContent

This static method reads the content of a file and returns it as a string. If the file does not exist, it returns an empty string.

```typescript
static getContent(path: string): string;
```

#### Parameters

- `path: string`: The path of the file to read.

#### Example

```typescript
const content = FileStructure.getContent('path/to/file.txt');
console.log(content);
```

### Method: readFileFromLine

This static method reads a file and returns the content between the specified start and end lines.

```typescript
static readFileFromLine(filename: string, startLine: number, endLine: number): string;
```

#### Parameters

- `filename: string`: The path of the file to read.
- `startLine: number`: The starting line number to read from.
- `endLine: number`: The ending line number to read to.

#### Example

```typescript
const content = FileStructure.readFileFromLine('path/to/file.txt', 1, 5);
console.log(content);
```

## Technical Concepts

### Path Resolution

The `path` module is used to resolve and manipulate file paths. In this code, the `path.relative` and `path.resolve` methods are used to calculate the relative path of the file.

### File System

The `fs` module is used to interact with the file system. In this code, the `fs.existsSync` and `fs.readFileSync` methods are used to check if a file exists and read its content, respectively.
