# FileStructure.ts

## Overview

The `FileStructure.ts` file is a TypeScript module that provides a class named `FileStructure`. This class is responsible for managing file structures, specifically for code files with the `.ts` (TypeScript) extension. It provides methods for creating a new instance of the class, checking if a file is a code file, and retrieving the content of a file.

## Usage

To use the `FileStructure` class, you need to import it into your TypeScript code:

```typescript
import FileStructure from "./FileStructure";
```

### Creating a new instance

To create a new instance of the `FileStructure` class, you need to provide a directory path and an entry object:

```typescript
const dir = "/path/to/directory";
const entry = { name: "example.ts" };
const fileStructure = new FileStructure(dir, entry);
```

### Checking if a file is a code file

To check if a file is a code file (TypeScript), you can use the `isCodeFile` static method:

```typescript
const fileName = "example.ts";
const isCodeFile = FileStructure.isCodeFile(fileName);
console.log(isCodeFile); // true
```

### Retrieving the content of a file

To get the content of a file, you can use the `getContent` static method:

```typescript
const filePath = "/path/to/file/example.ts";
const content = FileStructure.getContent(filePath);
console.log(content); // Content of the file
```

## Class Methods

### constructor(dir: string, entry: any)

The constructor method initializes a new instance of the `FileStructure` class. It takes two parameters:

- `dir` (string): The directory path where the file is located.
- `entry` (any): An object containing the file's name.

### isCodeFile(fileName: string): boolean

This static method checks if a given file is a TypeScript code file. It takes one parameter:

- `fileName` (string): The name of the file to check.

It returns a boolean value indicating whether the file is a TypeScript code file or not.

### getContent(path: string): string

This static method retrieves the content of a file. It takes one parameter:

- `path` (string): The path to the file.

It returns a string containing the content of the file. If the file does not exist, it returns an empty string.

## Technical Concepts

### ConfigHelper

The `ConfigHelper` class is imported from the `./ConfigHelper` module. It is used to get the project path from the configuration. This is not a standard concept, but it is used in the `FileStructure` class to resolve the relative path of the file.
