The `code-narrator.config.js` file is a configuration file for the Code Narrator documentation generator. It contains various settings and options that determine how the documentation is generated for your project. Here's a detailed description of the configuration options:

1. `entry_file`: The main entry point of your application.
2. `cli_file`: The entry point for the command-line interface.
3. `project_name`: The name of your project.
4. `config_files`: An array of configuration files for Code Narrator.
5. `readmeRoot`: A boolean indicating whether to generate a root README file.
6. `folderRootFileName`: The name of the root file for each folder.
7. `repository_url`: The URL of your project's repository.
8. `project_file`: The main project file, usually `package.json`.
9. `source_path`: The path to your project's source code.
10. `documentation_path`: The path where the generated documentation will be stored.
11. `test_path`: The path to your project's test files.
12. `include`: An array of file patterns to include in the documentation.
13. `generatorPlugin`: An array of generator plugins to use for generating documentation.
14. `builderPlugins`: An array of builder plugins to use for generating documentation.
15. `builders`: An array of builder configurations for generating different types of documentation.

To retrieve a value from the config file, you can use the `require` function in Node.js. For example, to get the `project_name` value, you can do the following:

```javascript
const config = require('./code-narrator.config.js');
console.log(config.project_name); // Output: "code-narrator"
```

Please note that the actual file paths and project-specific information in the example configuration may differ for your project. Make sure to adjust them accordingly.
