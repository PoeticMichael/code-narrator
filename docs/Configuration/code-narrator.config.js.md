Here is a detailed description of the `code-narrator.config.js` file and its purpose in the application:

The `code-narrator.config.js` file is a configuration file for the Code Narrator project. It contains various settings and configurations that are used by the application to generate documentation. The configuration object `config` is of type `ICodeNarratorConfig` and has the following properties:

- `entry_file`: The entry point file for the application (e.g., `./dist/src/App.js`).
- `cli_file`: The command-line interface file for the application (e.g., `./dist/src/cli.js`).
- `project_name`: The name of the project (e.g., `code-narrator`).
- `config_files`: An array of configuration files used by the project (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js"]`).
- `readmeRoot`: A boolean value indicating whether the README file should be treated as the root file.
- `repository_url`: The URL of the project's repository (e.g., `https://github.com/ingig/code-narrator`).
- `project_file`: The main project file (e.g., `package.json`).
- `source_path`: The path to the source code directory (e.g., `src`).
- `documentation_path`: The path to the documentation directory (e.g., `docs`).
- `test_path`: The path to the test directory (e.g., `__tests__`).
- `include`: An array of file patterns to include in the documentation generation process (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js", "__tests__/**/**", "src/**/*.ts"]`).
- `builders`: An array of builder objects that define how the documentation should be generated.
- `rootFileName`: The name of the root file for the documentation (e.g., `README`).

To retrieve a value from the config file, you can use the following example:

```javascript
const config = require('./code-narrator.config.js');
console.log(config.entry_file); // Output: "./dist/src/App.js"
```

:::note
Please note that the actual values in the configuration file may vary depending on the specific project setup.
