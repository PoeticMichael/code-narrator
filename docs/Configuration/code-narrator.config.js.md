Here is a detailed description of the `code-narrator.config.js` file and its purpose in the application:

The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator project. It contains various settings and configurations that are required for the proper functioning of the application. These settings include file paths, project details, and documentation generation options.

Below is a breakdown of the configuration properties in the `code-narrator.config.js` file:

- `entry_file`: The entry point of the application (e.g., `./dist/src/App.js`).
- `cli_file`: The path to the CLI file (e.g., `./dist/src/cli.js`).
- `project_name`: The name of the project (e.g., `code-narrator`).
- `config_files`: An array of configuration files used by the project (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js"]`).
- `readmeRoot`: A boolean value indicating whether the README file should be treated as the root of the documentation.
- `folderRootFileName`: The name of the root file for each folder in the documentation (e.g., `README`).
- `repository_url`: The URL of the project's repository (e.g., `https://github.com/ingig/code-narrator`).
- `project_file`: The path to the project's package.json file (e.g., `package.json`).
- `source_path`: The path to the source code directory (e.g., `src`).
- `documentation_path`: The path to the documentation directory (e.g., `docs`).
- `test_path`: The path to the test directory (e.g., `__tests__`).
- `include`: An array of file patterns to include in the documentation generation process (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js", "src/**/*.ts"]`).
- `builders`: An array of builder configurations for generating documentation. Each builder object contains properties such as `name`, `template`, `sidebarPosition`, `args`, `files`, and `type`.

To retrieve a value from the config file, you can use the following example:

```javascript
const config = require('./code-narrator.config.js');
console.log(config.entry_file); // Output: "./dist/src/App.js"
```

:::note
Please note that the actual values in the configuration file may vary depending on the specific project setup and requirements.
