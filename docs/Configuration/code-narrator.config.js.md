Here's a detailed description of the `code-narrator.config.js` file and its purpose in the application:

The `code-narrator.config.js` file is a configuration file for the Code Narrator project. It contains various settings and options that help customize the behavior of the Code Narrator tool. The configuration object `config` is of type `ICodeNarratorConfig` and has the following properties:

- `entry_file`: The entry point file of the application (e.g., `./dist/src/App.js`).
- `cli_file`: The command-line interface file of the application (e.g., `./dist/src/cli.js`).
- `project_name`: The name of the project (e.g., `code-narrator`).
- `config_files`: An array of configuration files for the project (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js"]`).
- `readmeRoot`: A boolean value indicating whether the root folder should have a README file.
- `folderRootFileName`: The name of the root folder's README file (e.g., `README`).
- `repository_url`: The URL of the project's repository (e.g., `https://github.com/ingig/code-narrator`).
- `project_file`: The main project file (e.g., `package.json`).
- `source_path`: The path to the source code folder (e.g., `src`).
- `documentation_path`: The path to the documentation folder (e.g., `docs`).
- `test_path`: The path to the test folder (e.g., `__tests__`).
- `include`: An array of file patterns to include in the documentation (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js", "src/**/*.ts"]`).
- `builders`: An array of builder objects that define how the documentation should be generated.

Each builder object in the `builders` array has the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the builder.
- `template`: The template to use for generating the documentation.
- `sidebarPosition`: The position of the sidebar in the documentation.
- `args`: An object containing arguments to pass to the builder.
- `files`: An array of file objects that define which files to include in the documentation.
- `type`: The type of the builder (e.g., `Custom`, `README`, `howto`).

To retrieve a value from the config file, you can use the `require` function in Node.js. For example, to get the `entry_file` value, you can do the following:

```javascript
const config = require('./code-narrator.config.js');
console.log(config.entry_file); // Output: "./dist/src/App.js"
```
