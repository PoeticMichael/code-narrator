The `code-narrator.config.js` file contains the configuration settings for the Code Narrator application. It is essential to set these configurations correctly to match your project requirements. Below is a detailed description of the configuration settings and their purpose in the application.

- `entry_file`: The entry point file for the application (e.g., `./dist/src/App.js`).
- `cli_file`: The command-line interface file for the application (e.g., `./dist/src/cli.js`).
- `project_name`: The name of the project (e.g., `code-narrator`).
- `config_files`: An array of configuration files used in the project (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js"]`).
- `readmeRoot`: A boolean value indicating whether the root folder should have a README file.
- `folderRootFileName`: The name of the root folder's README file (e.g., `README`).
- `repository_url`: The URL of the project's repository (e.g., `https://github.com/ingig/code-narrator`).
- `project_file`: The project's main file (e.g., `package.json`).
- `source_path`: The path to the source code folder (e.g., `src`).
- `documentation_path`: The path to the documentation folder (e.g., `docs`).
- `test_path`: The path to the test folder (e.g., `__tests__`).
- `include`: An array of files and folders to include in the documentation (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js", "src/**/*.ts"]`).
- `generatorPlugin`: An array of generator plugins used in the project.
- `builderPlugins`: An array of builder plugins used in the project, including `ConfigurationBuilder`, `FilesBuilder`, `FoldersBuilder`, and `UserDefinedBuilder`.
- `builders`: An array of builder configurations, each with its own settings such as `type`, `sidebarPosition`, `template`, `name`, `files`, `args`, `path`, `pages`, and more.

To retrieve a value from the config file, you can use the following example:

```javascript
const config = require("./code-narrator.config.js");
console.log(config.entry_file); // Output: "./dist/src/App.js"
```

In this example, we import the `code-narrator.config.js` file and access the `entry_file` property, which returns the value `./dist/src/App.js`.
