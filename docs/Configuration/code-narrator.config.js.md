Here is the detailed description of the `code-narrator.config.js` file and its purpose in the application:

```markdown
# code-narrator.config.js

This configuration file is used by the Code Narrator application to generate documentation for your project. It contains various settings and configurations that help the application understand your project structure and generate the appropriate documentation.

## Configuration Properties

- `entry_file`: The main entry file of your application (e.g., `./dist/src/App.js`).
- `cli_file`: The command-line interface file of your application (e.g., `./dist/src/cli.js`).
- `project_name`: The name of your project (e.g., `code-narrator`).
- `config_files`: An array of configuration files used by your project (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js"]`).
- `readmeRoot`: A boolean value indicating whether the README file should be generated at the root level of the documentation.
- `repository_url`: The URL of your project's repository (e.g., `https://github.com/ingig/code-narrator`).
- `project_file`: The main project file containing metadata about your project (e.g., `package.json`).
- `source_path`: The path to your project's source code (e.g., `src`).
- `documentation_path`: The path where the generated documentation will be stored (e.g., `docs`).
- `test_path`: The path to your project's test files (e.g., `__tests__`).
- `include`: An array of file patterns to include in the documentation generation process (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js", "__tests__/**/**", "src/**/*.ts"]`).
- `builders`: An array of builder configurations that define how the documentation should be generated.
- `generatorPlugin`: An array of generator plugins to be used during the documentation generation process.
- `sitemap`: An object containing sitemap configuration settings.
- `rootFileName`: The name of the root file for the generated documentation (e.g., `index.html`).

## Example: Retrieving from the Config File

To retrieve a value from the config file, you can use the following code snippet:

```javascript
const config = require("./code-narrator.config.js");
console.log(config.entry_file); // Output: "./dist/src/App.js"
```
```
