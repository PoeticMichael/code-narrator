Here is a detailed description of the `code-narrator.config.js` file and its purpose in the application:

The `code-narrator.config.js` file is a configuration file for the Code Narrator project. It contains various settings and options that are used by the application to generate documentation based on the project's source code and other files. The configuration object is of type `ICodeNarratorConfig`.

Below is a brief explanation of each property in the configuration object:

- `entry_file`: The entry point file for the application (e.g., `./dist/src/App.js`).
- `cli_file`: The command-line interface file for the application (e.g., `./dist/src/cli.js`).
- `project_name`: The name of the project (e.g., `code-narrator`).
- `config_files`: An array of configuration files used by the project (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js"]`).
- `readmeRoot`: A boolean value indicating whether the root folder should contain a README file.
- `folderRootFileName`: The name of the root folder's README file (e.g., `README`).
- `repository_url`: The URL of the project's repository (e.g., `https://github.com/ingig/code-narrator`).
- `project_file`: The project's package.json file (e.g., `package.json`).
- `source_path`: The path to the project's source code (e.g., `src`).
- `documentation_path`: The path to the project's documentation (e.g., `docs`).
- `test_path`: The path to the project's test files (e.g., `__tests__`).
- `include`: An array of file patterns to include in the documentation generation process (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js", "src/**/*.ts"]`).
- `builders`: An array of builder objects that define how the documentation should be generated.

To retrieve a value from the config file, you can use the `require` function in Node.js. For example, to get the `entry_file` value, you can do the following:

```javascript
const config = require('./code-narrator.config.js');
console.log(config.entry_file); // Output: "./dist/src/App.js"
```

Please note that the actual file paths and URLs in the example configuration may not be valid for your specific project. Make sure to adjust them according to your project's structure and requirements.
