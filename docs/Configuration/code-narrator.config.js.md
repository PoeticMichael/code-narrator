The `code-narrator.config.js` file is a configuration file for the Code Narrator documentation generator. It contains various settings and options that determine how the documentation is generated for your project. Here's a detailed description of the configuration options:

1. `entry_file`: The main entry point of your application (e.g., `./dist/src/App.js`).
2. `cli_file`: The command-line interface file for your application (e.g., `./dist/src/cli.js`).
3. `project_name`: The name of your project (e.g., `code-narrator`).
4. `config_files`: An array of configuration files for your project (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js"]`).
5. `readmeRoot`: A boolean value indicating whether the root README file should be included in the documentation.
6. `folderRootFileName`: The name of the root file for each folder in the documentation (e.g., `README`).
7. `repository_url`: The URL of your project's repository (e.g., `https://github.com/ingig/code-narrator`).
8. `project_file`: The main project file (e.g., `package.json`).
9. `source_path`: The path to your project's source code (e.g., `src`).
10. `documentation_path`: The path to your project's documentation (e.g., `docs`).
11. `test_path`: The path to your project's test files (e.g., `__tests__`).
12. `include`: An array of file patterns to include in the documentation (e.g., `["code-narrator.config.js", "src/**/*.ts"]`).
13. `generatorPlugin`: An array of generator plugins for the documentation.
14. `builderPlugins`: An array of builder plugins for the documentation (e.g., `[ConfigurationBuilder, FilesBuilder, FoldersBuilder, UserDefinedBuilder]`).
15. `builders`: An array of builder configurations for generating documentation pages.

To retrieve a value from the config file, you can use the `require` function in your code. For example, to get the `project_name` value, you can do the following:

```javascript
const config = require("./code-narrator.config.js");
console.log(config.project_name); // Output: "code-narrator"
```

Please note that the example provided is a specific configuration for the Code Narrator project. You should adjust the values and settings to match your own project's requirements.
