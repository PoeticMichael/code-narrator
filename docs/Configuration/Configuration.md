The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project name, repository URL, source paths, and documentation paths. Additionally, it specifies the builder plugins and generator plugins used by the application.

Here is an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the `config` object is defined with various properties such as `entry_file`, `cli_file`, `project_name`, and `config_files`. These properties are used to configure the application's behavior and settings. The `config` object is then exported as a module to be used by other parts of the application.

Regarding other configuration files, there are no other files mentioned in the provided content.
