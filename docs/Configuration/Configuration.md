The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project details, source paths, documentation paths, and more. This file also includes a list of builders that are responsible for generating different parts of the documentation.

Here's an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```js
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations
};
```

In this example, the `config` object contains various properties that define the application's configuration, such as the entry file, CLI file, project name, and a list of configuration files.

As for the other configuration files, I do not recognize them, so I cannot provide any information about them.
