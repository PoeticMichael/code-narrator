The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project details, source paths, documentation paths, and more. This file also specifies the builder plugins and generator plugins used by the application.

Here is an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the `config` object contains various settings for the Code Narrator application, such as the entry file, CLI file, project name, and a list of configuration files. The `config` object is then exported as a module to be used by other parts of the application.

Regarding other configuration files, there are no additional files mentioned in the provided content.
