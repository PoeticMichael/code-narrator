The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project details, documentation paths, and more. This file helps customize the behavior of the application according to the user's preferences.

Here's an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```js
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the `config` object contains various properties such as `entry_file`, `cli_file`, `project_name`, and `config_files`. These properties are used to define the entry point of the application, the CLI file, the project name, and the list of configuration files, respectively.

As for the other configuration files, without more information, it is not possible to provide a detailed description of their purpose in the application.
