The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project details, source paths, and documentation paths. This configuration file also specifies the builders that are responsible for generating different parts of the documentation.

Here's an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // Other configurations...
    builders: [
        {
            name: "Prerequisites",
            template: `prerequisites`,
            sidebarPosition: 2,
            args: {
                entryFileContent: 'content(./dist/src/cli.js)',
                configFile: 'content(code-narrator.config.js)'
            },
            files: [
                {
                    path: "package.json",
                    jsonPaths: [
                        "$.dependencies",
                        "$.devDependencies",
                        "$.engine"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            type: 'Custom'
        },
        // Other builders...
    ]
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the `config` object contains various settings for the Code Narrator application. The `builders` array contains objects that define different builders for generating documentation. For instance, the "Prerequisites" builder generates a section in the documentation with information about the project's dependencies, devDependencies, and engine from the `package.json` file.

As for the other configuration files, I cannot provide information about them without their content or context.
