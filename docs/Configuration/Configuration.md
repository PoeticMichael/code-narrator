The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project name, repository URL, source paths, documentation paths, and more. This file also defines builders, which are responsible for generating different types of documentation based on the provided templates and configurations.

Here's an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations ...
    builders: [
        {
            name: "Prerequisites",
            template: `prerequisites`,
            sidebarPosition: 2,
            args: {
                entryFileContent: 'content(./dist/src/cli.js)',
                configFile: 'content(code-narrator.config.js)'
            },
            files: [
                {
                    path: "package.json",
                    jsonPaths: [
                        "$.dependencies",
                        "$.devDependencies",
                        "$.engine"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            type: 'Custom'
        },
        // ... other builders ...
    ]
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the `config` object contains various settings for the Code Narrator application, such as the entry file, CLI file, project name, and configuration files. It also defines a custom builder named "Prerequisites" that uses the `prerequisites` template and has a sidebar position of 2. The builder takes arguments for the entry file content and the configuration file content, and it processes the `package.json` file to extract information about dependencies, devDependencies, and the engine.

As for the other configuration files, I cannot provide information about them without more context or details.
