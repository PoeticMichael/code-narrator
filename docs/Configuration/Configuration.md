The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project details, source paths, documentation paths, and more. This file also includes configurations for builders and generator plugins, which are responsible for generating documentation based on the provided settings.

Here is an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations
};
```

In this example, the `config` object contains various settings for the Code Narrator application, such as the entry file, CLI file, project name, and the list of configuration files.
