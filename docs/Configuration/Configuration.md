The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project details, and documentation generation settings.

The purpose of this configuration file is to allow users to customize the behavior of the Code Narrator application according to their specific needs and preferences.

Here's an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // Other configurations...
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the configuration file exports an object with various properties, such as `entry_file`, `cli_file`, `project_name`, and `config_files`. These properties are used by the Code Narrator application to determine the entry point of the application, the location of the CLI file, the name of the project, and the list of configuration files to be used.

As for the other configuration files, I do not recognize them, so I cannot provide any information about them.
