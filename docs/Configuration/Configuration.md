The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It contains various settings and configurations that determine how the application behaves and generates documentation.

The purpose of this configuration file is to provide a centralized location for managing the settings and configurations of the Code Narrator application. It allows developers to easily customize the behavior of the application to suit their specific needs.

Here is an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the `config` object contains various settings such as the entry file, CLI file, project name, and an array of configuration files. These settings are then exported as a module, allowing other parts of the application to access and use them.

Regarding other configuration files, there are no additional files mentioned in the provided content.
