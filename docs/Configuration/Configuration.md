The app-specific config file for code-narrator is `code-narrator.config.js`. This configuration file is used to define various settings and options for the code-narrator application. It helps in customizing the behavior of the application according to the user's requirements.

The purpose of this configuration file in the application is to provide a centralized place for managing settings and options related to the code-narrator application. It allows users to easily modify and update the configuration without having to change the application code.

An example of usage for the app-specific configs is as follows:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // other configurations...
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the configuration file exports an object containing various settings such as `entry_file`, `cli_file`, `project_name`, and `config_files`. These settings can be used by the application to customize its behavior.

As for the other configuration files, I do not recognize them, so I cannot provide any information about them.
