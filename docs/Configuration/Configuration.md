The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project name, repository URL, source and documentation paths, and more. This configuration file also includes settings for builder plugins and generator plugins, which are used to customize the documentation generation process.

Here's an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the `config` object contains various settings for the Code Narrator application, such as the entry file, CLI file, project name, and a list of configuration files. This object is then exported as a module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
