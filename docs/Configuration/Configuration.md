The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project details, documentation paths, and more. This file helps in customizing the behavior of the application according to the user's requirements.

Here's an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```js
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the `config` object contains various properties such as `entry_file`, `cli_file`, `project_name`, and `config_files`. These properties are used to configure the application's behavior, such as specifying the entry file, the CLI file, the project name, and the configuration files.

As for the other configuration files, there is not enough information provided to give a detailed description of each of them.
