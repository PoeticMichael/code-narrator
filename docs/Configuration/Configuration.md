The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry points, paths, and plugins. This file helps in customizing the behavior of the application according to the user's requirements.

Here is an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations
};
```

In this example, the `entry_file` and `cli_file` properties define the entry points for the application and the CLI, respectively. The `project_name` property specifies the name of the project, and the `config_files` property lists the configuration files used by the application.
