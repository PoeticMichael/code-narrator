The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project details, documentation paths, and builders for generating documentation.

Here is an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the `entry_file` and `cli_file` properties define the entry points for the application and the CLI, respectively. The `project_name` property specifies the name of the project, and the `config_files` array lists the configuration files used by the application.

The configuration file also includes other properties such as `readmeRoot`, `repository_url`, `project_file`, `source_path`, `documentation_path`, `test_path`, and `include`. These properties define various aspects of the project, such as the location of the README file, the repository URL, the project file (e.g., `package.json`), the source code path, the documentation path, the test path, and the files to be included in the documentation.

The `builders` property is an array of objects that define how the documentation should be generated. Each builder object has properties like `name`, `template`, `sidebarPosition`, `args`, `files`, and `type` that determine the structure and content of the generated documentation.

There are no other configuration files mentioned in the provided text.
