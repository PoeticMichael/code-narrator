The `code-narrator.config.js` file is an app-specific configuration file for the Code Narrator application. It is used to define various settings and configurations for the application, such as entry files, project name, repository URL, source and documentation paths, and more. This file also includes builder plugins and generator plugins, which are used to customize the documentation generation process.

Here is an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```javascript
const config = {
    entry_file: "./dist/src/App.js",
    cli_file: "./dist/src/cli.js",
    project_name: "code-narrator",
    config_files: [
        "code-narrator.config.js"
    ],
    // ... other configurations ...
};

module.exports = config;
```

In this example, the `config` object is defined with various properties such as `entry_file`, `cli_file`, `project_name`, and `config_files`. These properties are used to configure the Code Narrator application. The `config` object is then exported using `module.exports` so that it can be used by other parts of the application.

Regarding other configuration files, I cannot provide information about them as they are not mentioned in the provided text.
