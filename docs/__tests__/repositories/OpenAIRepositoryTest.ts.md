# OpenAIRepositoryTest.ts

This documentation provides an in-depth explanation of the `OpenAIRepositoryTest.ts` file, which contains tests for the `OpenAIRepository` class. The `OpenAIRepository` class is responsible for interacting with the OpenAI API to query questions and receive answers. This file uses Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, to test the functionality of the `OpenAIRepository` class.

## Test Suite: OpenAIRepository

The test suite for the `OpenAIRepository` class is defined using the `describe` function from Jest. This function groups the tests related to the `OpenAIRepository` class.

```javascript
describe('Test OpenAIRepository', () => {
  // Test cases go here
});
```

### Test: queryQuestions

This test case checks the functionality of the `queryQuestions` method in the `OpenAIRepository` class. The `queryQuestions` method takes an array of questions as input and returns an array of answers from the OpenAI API.

```javascript
it('should test queryQuestions', async () => {
  // Test implementation goes here
});
```

#### Mocking OpenAIApi

To test the `queryQuestions` method, we need to mock the `createCompletion` method of the `OpenAIApi` class. This is done using Jest's `spyOn` function, which allows us to replace the original implementation with a custom one. In this case, we return a mock response containing an array of choices.

```javascript
let spyOpenAIApi = jest.spyOn(OpenAIApi.prototype, 'createCompletion')
  .mockImplementation(() => {
    return {data : {
      choices : ['hello man', 'yes man']
      }} as any
  });
```

#### Testing the Functionality

After mocking the `createCompletion` method, we can create a new instance of the `OpenAIRepository` class and call the `queryQuestions` method with a sample array of questions. We then check if the `createCompletion` method was called once and if the returned answers match the expected output.

```javascript
let openAIRepository = new OpenAIRepository();
let answers = await openAIRepository.queryQuestions(questions);

expect(spyOpenAIApi).toBeCalledTimes(1);
```

In this test case, we verify that the `queryQuestions` method in the `OpenAIRepository` class works as expected by interacting with the mocked OpenAI API and returning the correct answers.
