# OpenAIRepositoryTest.ts

The `OpenAIRepositoryTest.ts` file is a code file that contains test cases for the `OpenAIRepository` class. This class is responsible for interacting with the OpenAI API to query questions and receive answers. The test cases in this file ensure that the `OpenAIRepository` class is functioning correctly.

- [Methods](#methods)
  - [queryQuestions](#queryquestions)
- [Technical Concepts](#technical-concepts)

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `OpenAIRepository` class:

```javascript
import OpenAIRepository from "../../src/repositories/OpenAIRepository";

const openAIRepository = new OpenAIRepository();
const questions = ['How are you?', 'What are you doing?'];
const answers = await openAIRepository.queryQuestions(questions);
console.log(answers);
```

## Methods

### queryQuestions

The `queryQuestions` method is responsible for sending an array of questions to the OpenAI API and returning an array of answers.

#### Parameters

- `questions`: An array of strings containing the questions to be sent to the OpenAI API.

#### Returns

- An array of strings containing the answers received from the OpenAI API.

## Technical Concepts

### Jest

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that is used in this file to create test cases for the `OpenAIRepository` class. It provides functions such as `describe`, `it`, and `expect` to create test suites, test cases, and assertions.

### Mocking

In this file, the `OpenAIApi` class is mocked using Jest's `spyOn` function. This allows the test cases to simulate the behavior of the OpenAI API without actually making API calls. The `mockImplementation` function is used to define the behavior of the mocked method.

## File Content

```javascript
import OpenAIRepository from "../../src/repositories/OpenAIRepository";
import {OpenAIApi} from "openai";
import {describe, expect} from '@jest/globals';

describe('Test OpenAIRepository', () => {

    it('should test queryQuestions', async () => {
        let questions = ['How are you?', 'What are you doing?']

        let spyOpenAIApi = jest.spyOn(OpenAIApi.prototype, 'createCompletion')
            .mockImplementation(() => {
                return {data : {
                    choices : ['hello man', 'yes man']
                    }} as any
            })

        let openAIRepository = new OpenAIRepository();
        let answers = await openAIRepository.queryQuestions(questions)

        expect(spyOpenAIApi).toBeCalledTimes(1);
    })

})
```
