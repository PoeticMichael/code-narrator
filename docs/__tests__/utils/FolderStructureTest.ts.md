# FolderStructureTest.ts

The file `FolderStructureTest.ts` is a code file containing test cases for the `FolderStructure` class. This documentation provides a detailed description of the code, examples of how to use the class, descriptions of each method, parameters in methods, and explanations of non-standard technical concepts.

## Introduction

The `FolderStructureTest.ts` file is responsible for testing the functionality of the `FolderStructure` class. The class is imported from the `../../src/utils/FolderStructure` module, and the `ConfigHelper` class is imported from the `../../src/config/ConfigHelper` module.

The main purpose of the `FolderStructure` class is to determine whether a given file or directory should be documented based on the configuration settings provided by the `ConfigHelper` class.

## Examples

To use the `FolderStructure` class, you need to import it and create an instance of the class. Here's an example of how to use the `FolderStructure` class:

```javascript
import FolderStructure from "../../src/utils/FolderStructure";
import ConfigHelper from "../../src/config/ConfigHelper";

(async () => {
  await ConfigHelper.load({ project_file: "package.json" });
  ConfigHelper.config.include = ["src/**/*.ts"];
  ConfigHelper.config.exclude = [".env"];

  const folderStructure = new FolderStructure();
  const shouldDocument = folderStructure.shouldDocument("src/App.ts", false);
  console.log(shouldDocument); // true
})();
```

## Methods

### shouldDocument

The `shouldDocument` method is a static method that takes a file or directory path and a boolean value indicating whether the path is a directory or not. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the file or directory should be documented based on the configuration settings provided by the `ConfigHelper` class.

```javascript
static shouldDocument(path: string, isDirectory: boolean): boolean;
```

## Parameters

The `shouldDocument` method accepts the following parameters:

- `path` (string): The file or directory path to be checked for documentation.
- `isDirectory` (boolean): A boolean value indicating whether the path is a directory or not.

## Test Cases

The `FolderStructureTest.ts` file contains a single test suite with one test case:

- `test shouldDocument`: This test case checks if the `shouldDocument` method returns the correct boolean value for different file and directory paths based on the configuration settings provided by the `ConfigHelper` class. The test case uses an array of objects containing the path, isDirectory flag, and the expected result for each test scenario. The test case iterates through the array and checks if the result of the `shouldDocument` method matches the expected result for each scenario.
