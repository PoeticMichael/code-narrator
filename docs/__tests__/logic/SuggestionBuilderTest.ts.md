# SuggestionBuilderTest.ts

SuggestionBuilderTest.ts is a test file for the `DocumentationBuilder` class, which is responsible for generating a Markdown (.md) file containing the project description, installation instructions, and usage information. The test ensures that the `DocumentationBuilder` class functions as expected.

## Description

The `SuggestionBuilderTest.ts` file contains a single test suite, which tests the `DocumentationBuilder` class. The test suite has one test case, which checks if the `DocumentationBuilder` can successfully create a Markdown file with the project description, installation instructions, and usage information.

## Examples

To use the `DocumentationBuilder` class, you can follow the example provided in the test case:

```typescript
import DocumentationBuilder from "../../src/documentation/DocumentationBuilder";

let builder = new DocumentationBuilder();
await builder.build();
```

## Methods

### build()

The `build()` method is an asynchronous method that creates a Markdown file with the project description, installation instructions, and usage information. It uses the `package.json` file to get the project name, installation instructions, and module usage information.

#### Parameters

This method does not have any parameters.

## Technical Concepts

- **describe**: In the test file, `describe` is a function provided by the testing framework (Jest) to group related test cases. It takes two arguments: a string describing the test suite and a callback function containing the test cases.
- **it**: `it` is another function provided by Jest to define individual test cases. It also takes two arguments: a string describing the test case and a callback function containing the test logic.
- **async/await**: The `async/await` syntax is used to work with promises in a more readable and concise way. In this test file, the `build()` method returns a promise, so the `await` keyword is used to wait for the promise to resolve before continuing with the test execution.
