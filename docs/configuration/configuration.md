The app-specific config file you provided is `code-narrator.config.ts`. This configuration file is used to set up the Code Narrator documentation generation tool. It defines the project settings, builder plugins, generator plugins, and other configurations required for generating documentation in the desired format.

Here's an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```typescript
import CodeNarrator from "code-narrator";

const config = require("./code-narrator.config.ts");

const codeNarrator = new CodeNarrator(config);
codeNarrator.generateDocumentation();
```

In this example, the `code-narrator.config.ts` file is imported and used to create a new instance of the Code Narrator tool. The `generateDocumentation()` method is then called to generate the documentation based on the provided configuration.

As for the other configuration files you mentioned:

1. `jest.config.js`: This is a configuration file for Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. It contains settings and options related to running tests, such as test environment, test coverage, and mocking.

2. `package.json`: This is a standard configuration file for Node.js projects. It contains metadata about the project, such as name, version, description, and dependencies. It also includes scripts that can be run using the `npm` command.

3. `tsconfig.json`: This is a configuration file for TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript. It contains settings and options related to TypeScript compilation, such as target JavaScript version, module resolution, and type checking options.
