# code-narrator

## Description

[code-narrator](https://github.com/ingig/code-narrator) uses OpenAI to generate documentation for your source code, as well create HowTo, FAQ, Tutorial, and other custom pages. Code-narrator documents itself and should be a validation of the documentation working, similar to a compiler compiling itself. Configuration `code-narrator.config.js` file is created on the first run and sets the configuration for your project, such as project path, doc, documentation type, and more. The package can be installed using `npm i code-narrator -D`. code-narrator is code language, linguistic & framework neutral. It keeps your documentation always up to date.

## Getting Started

1. Install the package:

```bash
npm i code-narrator -D
```

2. Run code-narrator:

```bash
npx code-narrator
```

## Usage

After installing and running code-narrator, a configuration file `code-narrator.config.js` will be generated. Modify this file to set the configuration for your project, such as project path, doc, documentation type, and more.
