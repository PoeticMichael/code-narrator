# Code-Narrator

Code-Narrator is a tool that uses OpenAI to generate documentation for your source code, as well as easy HowTo guides and other custom pages. Code-narrator documents itself and should be a validation of the documentation working, similar to a compiler compiling itself. A configuration `code-narrator.config.js` file is created on the first run and sets the configuration for your project, such as project path, doc, documentation type, and more.

## Getting Started

1. Install the npm package:

```bash
npm i code-narrator -D
```

2. Run the tool with npx:

```bash
npx code-narrator
```

## Configuration

Configuration is optional and will be generated on the first run. You can modify the `code-narrator.config.js` file to customize the settings for your project.
