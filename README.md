# code-narrator

Uses OpenAI to generate documentation for your source code, as well as easy HowTo guides and other custom pages. Code-narrator documents it self and should be a validation of the documentation working, similar to a compiler compiling it self. Configuration `code-narrator.config.js` file is created on first run and sets the configuration for your project, such as project path, doc, documentation type and more. The package can be installed using `npm i code-narrator -D`. code-narrator is language & framework neutral.
